o local_cahce should be optimized to proxy calls
  only to read_fragment and write_fragment in
  actionpack/lib/action_controller/caching/fragments.rb.

  Now it unnecessarily proxies all caching calls when
  fragment caching is really the only thing that needs
  the proxy.

o Test cases should include a proper integration test
  to test controller/view interaction with the proxy.
